    <p><em>SAP Development Consultant</em></p>
    <p><em><strong>Mindtree</strong></em></p>
    <p><em><strong>Bluefin Solutions</strong></em></p>
    <p>I have spent 7 years at Bluefin Solutions and Mindtree as an SAP development consultant. I have previously specialised in back end ABAP development
        working mainly in SAP BW systems. I have since transitioned into a Fiori full stack development consultant, utilising Javascript with the SAP UI5
        framework, Gateway, CDS and other ABAP back end work. I have been in this full stack role for over two years now.
